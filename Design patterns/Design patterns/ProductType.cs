/*Design Patterns:
Design patterns, on the other hand, are specific solutions to recurring design problems that have been proven effective over time. 
They are more focused on actual implementations and code-level details. Design patterns provide 
concrete templates for solving certain types of problems by organizing classes and objects in a particular way. 
They can be thought of as blueprints that you can follow to solve common design challenges
